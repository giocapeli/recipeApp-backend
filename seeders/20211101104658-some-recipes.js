Refrigerate for 1 hour, turning occasionally. While the pork is marinating, soak skewers in water for about 20 minutes prior to using them. That will help the skewers to not burn up when exposed to the flame. Preheat an outdoor grill or indoor grill pan to medium-high heat and lightly grease the grates with a small amount of vegetable oil. Thread the skewers with marinated pork, pineapple, and red pepper, alternating back and forth; discard the marinade. Cook skewers on the preheated grill until they obtain grill marks and the pork is no longer pink, about 2 minutes per side. Garnish with green onions and sesame seeds.",
